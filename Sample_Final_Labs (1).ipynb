    "Dear Students,\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the sample final test for our laboratory course. This test is designed to assess your understanding and application of the concepts and techniques we have covered throughout the semester. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Read Each Question Carefully: Ensure you understand what is being asked before you start coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write Clean and Commented Code: Your code should be well-organized and include comments explaining your logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Your Code: Make sure to test your code with different inputs to ensure it works correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions: Make final decisions, decide about the statistical and practical significance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to use your notes, textbooks, and online resources to help you complete the test. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Please be advised that the use of any Generative AI (GenAI) tools is strictly prohibited during this test. This includes, but is not limited to, tools that generate code, text, or any other form of content based on AI algorithms.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration with classmates is not permitted. This test is an individual assessment of your skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "I encourage you to take your time and approach each question methodically. This test is an opportunity to demonstrate your proficiency and understanding of the material. \n",
